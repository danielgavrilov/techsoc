### Introduction

With the use of the Oculus Rift and Wii remotes, join us as we build a virtual reality game from the ground up!

We have decided to create a dungeon crawler, you need to defeat enemies and solve puzzles to progress to the further levels.

The project is open to beginners as we'll be teaching how to create models, animate them and make them interact within the game to create an awesome virtual reality experience.

As with every TechSoc project, we take a team based approach to learning, there is active discussion and your opinions influence the outcome of the game. If you are up for a challenge and want to learn something new &mdash; join us!

### Technologies used
