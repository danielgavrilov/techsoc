# Introduction

UCLMeets is an Android app that works out when you and your friends are free and suggests events around UCL for your group to attend.

Ultimately, it's the time spent with friends that makes university life memorable, so stop wasting time figuring out when everyone is free - simply use the app: it works out when everyone is free and suggests events based on that.

You need some experience with Java to join this project, and we'll be working in teams to develop different parts and bring it all together in the end!

# Technologies used

- Android SDK
- Parse
- Google Calendar API
