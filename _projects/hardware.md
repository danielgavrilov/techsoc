excerpt: We will work on some cool raspberry pi powered robots together!

##Introduction
We will use Raspberry Pi powered robots with cameras on them (plus some additional sensors that we may get later).
We will work on a making a simple interface to the robots in order to move them and use their sensors, so that they will be used in outreach activities for an educational goal. 
We will also use this interface inside a bigger system that will let us move our robots from our laptops through a browser page.
