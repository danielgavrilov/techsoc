##Introduction

For the VR Project we will use Unity together with the Oculus VR in order to build the game and Blender to design the 3D models.
The game will be divided in different levels and people participating to the project will plan, design and build the different levels in small sub-teams. 
We will have small intros to Unity and Blender in order to help people that have never used them. We will also spend some sessions brain-storming the different levels, it will be a funny creative exercise.
