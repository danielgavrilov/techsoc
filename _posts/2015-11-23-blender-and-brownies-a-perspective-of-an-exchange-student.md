This is my exchange year and therefore the only year at UCL, so in order to get the most out of my experience here, I have been looking at the school clubs and societies before I arrived in London.

I know that I want to be involved in tech-related club and do some cool stuff, and thatâ€™s how I found out TechSoc and their 3D workshop - Blender and Brownies. I had to admit that I was attracted by its name, especially the brownie part, at first.

Jack is a great teacher, and his instructions are well-organized and really clear. We started from installing Blender, and built a 3D acropolis model in the first session. In the following sessions, we built a wine glass and a bouncing ball animation. One thing I really like about the worksop is that everyone, with or without experience, is welcome to join as long as they are willing to learn.

Jack and other TechSoc members are really trying to help everyone be on the same page and understand the materials. I have always believed that the only way to learn is by doing it, and I am really impressed with what TechSoc is doing now - building a innovative, collaborative, and welcoming community.
