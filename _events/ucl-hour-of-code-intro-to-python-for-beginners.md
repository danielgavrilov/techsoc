**This event is open to all UCL students, regardless of TechSoc membership and is aimed at complete beginners to programming**

Join us for a fun, relaxed and beginner-friendly introduction to Python. No prior experience is required and we'll guide you through an interactive activity to get you up and running with Python.

We are running this as part of the "Hour Of Code", an initiative to get more people coding. It's backed by some pretty big names, but the most important thing is - if you have the slightest interest in coding but have been too intimidated/scared to start, this is perfect for you!

We hope to see you there =]
