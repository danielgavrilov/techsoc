Hey guys! We're starting projects with a VR taster session! You will be able to come along and get to play with the Oculus Rift and Google Cardboard so you can experience some demos on it for yourself! 

You'll get to ask questions about TechSoc's very own VR project and how you can get involved.

To be very clear: there are no pre-requistes in terms of technical knowledge and the taster event is open to all. If you have the slightest interest in virtual reality or gaming, tag along - it might something you really enjoy!

If there are any questions, please get in touch ( Message Vicky Dineshchandra ) 

See you all there!
