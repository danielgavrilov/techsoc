We're really excited to announce a follow up workshop, hosted and taught by security consultants from MWR InfoSecurity! Don't worry if you haven't had too much experience with security before - the topics are designed to cover as much as possible while still being friendly to newcomers. There's also going to be a reverse engineering challenge (with prizes!) at the end of the workshop.  

We should be hosting a VM file with all the tools you need in the next few days - we'll let you know when that goes up.
