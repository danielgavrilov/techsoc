This event is open to all UCL students.  

We will be visiting King's offices (15 min away from us) -  the creators of Candy Crush Saga!  

Food and drinks will be provided.   

During the visit, there will be a presentation on - “1 trillion levels played, 20 billion data points a day: How Data Scientists at King gain insights into some of the world’s most popular games" by Vince Darley - King's Chief Data Scientist.  

Other members of staff will join for networking and drinks with the students following Vince’s talk. This will include Developers, Data Scientists and more professionals from their Studios.
