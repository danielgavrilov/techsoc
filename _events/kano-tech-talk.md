We've invited one of London's most awesome & successful edtech startups for a talk on building a computer anyone can make, Kano!

A computer and coding kit for all ages, all over the world. Simple as Lego, powered by Pi. Make games, learn code, create the future.

Their first product was crowdfunded on Kickstarter (with Steve Wozniak as one of their first customers), and the company is now backed by Index Ventures and Breyer Capital. They'll soon be releasing a Build-It-Yourself HD Touch Screen Display!


Our Speaker:
Alejandro Simon - Head of Software (and 1st employee) at Kano.

As Kano’s first employee, he’s seen it all. From packing the first Kano boxes through to their global expansion. Alejandro will be sharing his insights into how to build a global tech company whose mission is to give young people a simple, fun way to make and play with technology, and take control of the world around them. Inspiring creativity with technology is our goal.


As TechSoc, we care a lot about the technology that fuels business, and this is why we invited Alejandro Simon to come down and talk about his journey architecting Kano's open-source software, and building the brains of the Kano computer.
