We're proud to announce the UK's largest collaborative student-run hackathon, HackLondon.

Just like a hack, it started with an idea. And now, KCL Tech Society, UCLU Technology Society and UCL Entrepreneurs have come together and decided to work on a collaboration bigger than ever before.

Organised and run by three of the UK's fastest-growing and award-winning societies, HackLondon is the biggest student-run inter-university hackathon in the UK. 200 students will be hacking the weekend away at King's College London starting the 28th of February.

We won't give you all the details at once, but we can tell you it'll be the first hackathon experience of its kind.
Sounds awesome? What are you waiting for?
