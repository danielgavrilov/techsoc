Hey everyone! Time to roll on with development of our Android project!

We figured out our idea!

An app which works out when people are free based on their UCL timetables and suggests events around UCL that they can go together in their free time! 

So here's what we will be doing in this session:

We will first break down the app into different componets and make groups to work on each componet. - Don't worry if you are not that experienced, we'll assign someone with experience to "lead" it so you'll get to learn something! 

As is the custom with all projects, we won't dictate what you can or cannot use to build the project, it's a group decision so feel free to come with suggestions for the stack! 

We also need to pick a name, so get thinking! 

Also, if you haven't already done so: please buy TechSoc membership, it's only Â£2! The more members we have, the more companies will want to run events with us!
