Join us for a Tech Talk on the Python programming language from Francois Bouet, Software Engineer at Credit Suisse in the Data Analytics/Architecture and Semantic Technology team.

Suitable for beginners, as well as engineers and people studying STEM subjects, the talk will talk about Python from a conceptual approach, and look at the big picture of the Python ecosystem and where it sits as a language.

There will be time for Q&A, where he will be able to share more about his experiences having not come from a Computer Science background, and as a developer & data scientist in both the startup world and the corporate world.

Alongside his work at Credit Suisse, Francois is also a FinTech mentor for Startupbootcamp. Prior to joining the bank as a data scientist/engineer, he was a Lead Developer at a hot fintech startup based in Level39, Growth Intelligence. He did his Bachelors degree in Aerospace Engineering, interning at Airbus & ONERA, and did a Masters in Control Systems Engineering.


In his words:

I work on backend services, cluster computing and machine learning.

Over the past years, I joined two early-stage start-ups as a software engineer, working on web and big data projects. My interest in data-driven systems has lead me to use a wide array of technologies centred around Linux and open source software, in both startups and enterprises.

Before making the jump to the startup world, I got a Masters in control systems engineering for the aerospace industry, which instilled in me a passion for performance and automation.
