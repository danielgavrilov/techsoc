Coding & Cookies is TechSoc's flagship free coding workshops for all members. This year, we will have 5 series of workshops: Intro to Front-End, Hackathon Ready, Intro to Back-End & Full-Stack, Python for Data Science, and Machine Learning.  
  
Every class is free and will come with free cookies for all attendees  :)   
  
Open to beginners, our Intro to Front-End series will be a great introduction to the wide world of coding by starting with what makes websites and web applications.  
  
Spaces are first come first serve, so come early to get a seat!  
  
This session is all about JavaScript, for people who are new to web programming.  
  
Learn about making interactive UIs, and about the power of JS on both the Front-End and Backend of a website.   
  
In terms of programming, we'll be focusing on Front-End for this workshop.  
  
Knowledge of basic HTML is assumed!
