Coding & Cookies is TechSoc's flagship free coding workshops for all members. This year, we will have 5 series of workshops: Intro to Front-End, Hackathon Ready, Intro to Back-End & Full-Stack, Python for Data Science, and Machine Learning.   

Every class is free and will come with free cookies for all attendees :)   

Open to complete beginners, our Intro to Front-End series will be a great introduction to the wide world of coding by starting with what makes websites and web applications.  

Spaces are first come first serve, so come early to get a seat!  

We will talk about why you should learn to code, and how to go about learning it, as well as diving into the concepts and actual coding!  

The first session of this series will introduce you to what makes a website, basic coding concepts in Web Development (what is Front-End vs Back-End?), and give you a rough overview of how the Internet works.   

In terms of coding languages, there will be a specific focus on HTML and a bit of JavaScript.  

If you're curious about coding and want to give it a shot, have never done it and want to find out about it, or are interested in getting into it and want a place to start, come join us!
