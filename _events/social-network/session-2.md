Let's build a social network for social good =)

This week I'll cover some Django and we can get the main front page site up!

** Updates from last session!

The git reppo can be found here: https://github.com/techsoc/UCLInspires

Tasks completed so far:
+ Rough schema design for backend
+ Designing front page, main dashboard (needs to be revised)


What are we building?

A web platform that allows university students to share resources, advice and outreach opportunities to promote computer science.

What are the requirements for to join this project?

Some basic HTML/CSS or basic Python. Aslong as you are interested/willing to learn you'll be upto speed!

What are we using it to build it?

We're using Django, a python based web framework.
The best tutorial for this I've come across is: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/
Or on YouTube:
