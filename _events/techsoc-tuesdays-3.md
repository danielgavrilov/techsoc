We hope you've had a fun reading week / BathHack! Come and join us at The Rocket in Euston for drinks, starting at 7.30pm (after the Bloomberg talk). Afterwards we'll head on to the Euston Flyer which is just down the road.

Feel free to bring any friends along, especially if they're interested in the society. We're looking forward to seeing you there!
