For those of you who have been living in a cave these past few years, there is a new Star Wars film coming out!  

For those of you who haven't been, you're going right? Right?  

Enjoy the EPIC experience in a 70 mm Imax theatre at the Science Museum!  

Come to the dark side, we have bad memes and popcorn.   

(You know you want to wink emoticon )  

Date: 18th December  
Time: 13:10 showing  

You'll have to get a tube there as the Science Museum is next to Imperial.
