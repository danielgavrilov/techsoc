You're applying for a job in a tech company and are preparing for the dreaded coding interview. Some of these questions seem daunting, even impossible.

Bring the questions you're stuck on and let's work on them together.

Basically the format of the event is this:
Alex willl bring a couple of questions for us to work on and then we can all divide into pairs and work on presenting a solution to our partner. We want to recreate the high presssure interview environment as much as possible. Then we'll reconvene and discuss strategies as a group.

_Please_ bring paper/pencils and some interview questions for others.
