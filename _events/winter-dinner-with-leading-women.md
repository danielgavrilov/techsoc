We're holding a fantastic dinner with UCL Leading Women at a brilliant restaurant literally 5-10 minutes from campus, Number twelve!   

Join us for a delicious 3 course sit down dinner with free booze.  

We've invited our alumni, and some really exciting technologists from our sponsor companies & companies we've partnered with, including Bloomberg, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs.   

Italian fusion food will be served, and menu choices will be sent to all those who have bought a ticket.   

Vegetarian and non-meat options are available.   

Hope to see you there!   

This event is exclusively for our members.
