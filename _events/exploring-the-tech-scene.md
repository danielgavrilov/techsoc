London is undoubtedly THE place to be a technologist in the UK. There are opportunities around every corner, particularly for students, but it can be difficult to know where to start looking. That's where we come in.

In this session, we'll be giving you a whistle-stop tour of all the opportunities that we offer, as well as those in the London and UK tech communities, and even abroad!

Join us to find out more about awesome tech events, competitions, scholarships and career opportunities you can get involved with and to get advice on how you can prepare to make the most of them.
