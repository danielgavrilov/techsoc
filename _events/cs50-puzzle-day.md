To kick off the start of UCLU Tech Society's CS50 course, we are holding CS50's Puzzle Day. No prior programming skills are needed and anyone in UCL is welcome to attend. This is a three hour event where students interested in programming come together to solve challenging, but fun, puzzles from Harvard University's CS50 Puzzle Day that will push participants to find patterns, think logically and collaborate with others, just like a programmer would!   
  
At Puzzle Day, you will also have the opportunity to find out more about the CS50 sessions that we are organising. So join us for an afternoon of Computer Science and fun! Snacks will be provided at the event.
