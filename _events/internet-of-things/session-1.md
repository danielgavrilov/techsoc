In essence, the Internet of Things is a network of smart sensors that can monitor data which is later processed into meaningful observations which can then be used to make smarter, more informed decisions to optimize different parts of our lives through the devices we connect with on a daily basis.   

We'll be building a component which integrates into an IoT platform which can provide meaningful data and which can then be used by other devices in the network.   

Come along to find what exactly is involved!
