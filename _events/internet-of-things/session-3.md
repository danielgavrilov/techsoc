We're back with the third IoT session. Now that we know what we are making, I'll be bringing in some hardware so you can play with (and we can also order some more if people want).  

You can find the repo at <http://github.com/techsoc/iot>.   

Post your github name below so I can add you a collaborator!  

If you don't know what GitHub is or how to use it, I can explain on the day :)
