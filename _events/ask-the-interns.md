It's internship-hunting season once again!

Many companies have opened applications to internship schemes or will do very soon, and we want to help our members get a taste of what all the hype is about.

Find out first-hand from a panel of our very own UCL techies what it's like to be an intern at a range of companies including Facebook, Google, Credit Suisse, Bloomberg and more. There'll be plenty of tips regarding applications, the interview process, and making the most of the experience once you receive an offer.

The session will be split into some quick presentations by each panel member and some AMA time for you to get answers to those burning questions you've had saved up, so make sure to bring them along with you!
