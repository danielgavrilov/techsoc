UPDATE: All the tickets have gone but a waitlist system is in operation so stay tuned! :)

Join us as we head off to Nottingham for UoN HackSoc's annual hackathon, HackNotts! (<http://www.hacknotts.com/>)

"Hosted in the historic city of Nottingham, home to many folk of legend and lore, there will be feasts, fun and code galore. As the autumn season reaches its prime, we will hack, make and engineer the wonders of our time.

HackNotts is the annual student-run hackathon at the University of Nottingham. Students will come from all over the world to make, build and make awesome stuff!"

Fun, free food, and free travel. (Probably) :)
