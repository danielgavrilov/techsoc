Data is the blood that runs through the veins of our technological infrastructure. We live in a time where our technology increasingly becomes an extension of self, and where our personal data is hardly personal. Data can be ‘big’, ‘meta’, ‘open’, and ‘closed’. But it is also culture, art, insight and ultimately, human.   

We and the VINAYA Lab invite you for an evening of debate surrounding a term that has become much like a ‘four letter word’.  

Join us at VINAYA House as we hear from a panel of speakers (TBA) on this topic. Everyone interested is welcome. Ticket link is above.  

Drinks and nibbles will be provided.
