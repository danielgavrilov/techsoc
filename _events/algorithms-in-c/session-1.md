We'll be teaching how to code some algorithms using the C programming language!

Whilst the material covered is very close the C and Theory modules taught in the first year CS program, the workshops are open to anyone who wants to learn C or algorithms!

If you've been confused by anything in COMP101P or COMP102P then come along because you might just pick something up. We are going to cover the topics that people found most tough in the catch up sessions survey we sent round a week or so ago.

Hope to see you all there :)
