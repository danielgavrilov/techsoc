We are holding another show and tell!  
  
The gist is you'll get 5 mins to present your project to everyone, talk about what you used to build it and then we can give each other feedback and if the project is really interesting we can even collaborate later on!  
  
You don't have to showcase polished, finished projects, it's perfect if you are half way through an app/website/etc.  
  
It'll be a chilled evenning, if you just want to come to see what everyone's working on - you are free to! We'll even throw in some small bites just for you lovely people xD
