Tech Night LDN is a mini-conference embracing diversity by raising the visibility of accomplished women and underrepresented groups in tech and focussing on their achievements and knowledge.  

The evening will feature talks, panels and networking for people of all genders who are curious about technology. Expect an evening of inspiration and motivation!  

The event is open to all university students and graduates less than two years out of university of any technical skill level (including complete beginners) and best of all... it's absolutely free!  

Our confirmed speakers include:  
Kathryn Parsons - CEO & Co-founder at [Decoded](http://decoded.com)  
Rob Whithead - CTO & Co-founder at [Improbable](http://improbable.io)  

Don't know how to code but want to find out what it's all about? IBM will also be running an introductory coding workshop on the night.  

Tickets and the schedule will be released soon, so stay tuned for updates!  

The event is generously supported by Warwick Business School, Credit Suisse and Major League Hacking.
