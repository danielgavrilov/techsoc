Hey we're rolling on with our VR game! 

Last week we told you how to add objects onto the pane and make them move. 

This week we'll be breaking into different teams , designing and creating models to be put onto the game. We will have the Oculus to test it after half term! 

If you aren't on our Slack, join it by signing up here <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ax_Vil4yGvfO-59tffdXTporOsA368AfTT9tnfrWaag/viewform>

A few more updates to follow! :)
