Suffering from HackLondon withdrawals?

Need some London student hacking to keep you going until 2016?

Luckily for you, our friends at KCL Tech are running HackKing's. Let's go show them what we're made of. ;)

"HackKing's is a 24 hour hackathon hosted by KCL Tech. 150 people. 24 hours. 1 crowned team.

From (half) the team that brought you HackLondon, we're proud to announce that HackKing's is back, and it's going to be better than ever!"

Tickets are being released in weekly batches. To find out when they'll be available, sign up to their newsletter on their website or keep an eye on this event for reminders!
