UCLU TechSoc and Imperial College DoCSoc have decided to come together and have our first mixer event of the year!

It's a great chance to meet and talk to other students in London with the same interests in tech and have lots of fun!

The event will be at ULU Library (the bar) from 7pm. Free drinks will be provided.

Hope to see as many of you there as possible!
