We are starting the virtual reality project! A lot of you have had the chance to experience and now we will be creating a game for the Oculus! There is no prior experience required, we will teach you from the ground up. This is a group project so everyones opinion will be considered in making the game.

Projects are a great way to learn new things, all of which aren't covered in your day to day degree.
