Join She Plus Plus London and UCLU Technology Society for our Hour Of Code next week!   
  
Open to all students completely new to technology, or wanting to give security a shot, come along! Absolute beginners welcome.  
  
With the passing of the recent Investigatory Powers Bill, and increased rate of companies and governments being hacked, many of us want to know what exactly is happening and what is going on behind the scenes of the technology we use daily.   
  
On 7th December, come along for an exciting intro to arguably one of the most exciting fields of technology, security, in our Hour of Code event at UCL!  
  
We'll be hearing from Mustafa Al-Bassam, a Doctoral Researcher at the University College London Computer Science Information Security group, and Advisor at Secure Trading.   
Then we'll get into teams to make a start to learn more about security, hands on with a Capture the Flag game.  
  
As with all Hour of Code events, this will be hands on - so please bring your own latptops, fully charged!  
  
We will also have a raffle on the evening for a YubiKey, and more, all you have to do is show up and bring a friend!  
  
Food and drinks provided.  
  
Please RSVP here so we know how much food to provide!
