Want to release your app on the Kano OS for 70k users? (And win a Kano kit?)

In 2.5 months, make an app that can be deployed on the Kano OS and the best one will win! The theme is open as long as the app would be usable by an 8 year old, educational apps preferred.

Stay tuned for more details, make sure to turn up this event to find out more about the competition, how to build the app and what Kano libraries are currently available.

Competition ends: 30th January 2016
Award Ceremony / Public Demo: 4th February 2016

There will also be a Make Art Challenge (Round 2) for everyone who missed out on the workshop! (And those who want more ;))

Location: Public Cluster 105, Level 1 of the UCLU building on 25 Gordon Street.

Event will be lead by Alejandro Simon, Head of Software & first employee at Kano, and Joanna Bersin, Head of Education.
