We are holding a show and tell for our members!  

You get 5 mins to present your project to everyone, talk about what you used to build it and then we can give each other feedback and possibly help you find collaborators!  

You don't have to showcase polished, finished projects, it's perfect if you are half way through an app.  

It'll be a chilled evening, if you just want to come to see what everyone's working on - you are free to! We'll even throw in some small bites just for you lovely people xD  

If you want to present, post a comment below! If you have a questions, post it below! :)
