Hey everyone! We've changed the timings of the VR project session based on the Doodle so it's convienient for more people!

Please have Unity already installed before you come (as this will save so much time): <https://unity3d.com/get-unity>

As well as Blender: <https://www.blender.org/>

Also bring yourselves!

Plan for the session:

* Clarify the project idea

We'll teach you to:

* Import Blender objects/ 3D models into Unity and set up a basic environment.

* Make objects move using keyboard input.

* Change perspective (first person vs third person)

Then we'll start working on the game and start making models, using skills learnt from the 3D workshop. If you didn't go to the 3D workshop that's fine, we'll sort something out!

Depending on group consensus, we can break out into teams and work on different models and put it all together.

I'll be explaining how the Slack channel and Facebook group will work on the day!

We can't wait to start working on the project!

If anyone has questions, get in touch!
