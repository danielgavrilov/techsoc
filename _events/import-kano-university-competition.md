Calling all university students and recent graduates in the UK!   
  
Build an open-source app that engages the next generation in our competition with Kano.  
  
The winning app will be used on the Kano OS by 70k+ users and the winning team will win a Kano kit each.  
  
The theme is open as long as the app would be usable by an 8 year old, although educational apps are preferred.  
  
This is your chance to change the way kids learn and play.
