Hey guys!

This week we are going to start with sorting and searching algorithms - we will walk through bubble & insertion sorts, which are not that efficient and then explain advantages of binary search vs linear search.

Also, if you are fancy tackling a few challenging problems, we have prepared three of them for you to hone your skills.

Looking forward to you!
Horatiu & Jaro
