During this first session we will explain the structure of the Hardware Project and we will start exploring the possibilities that we have with our robots!  
  
- We will be using Raspberry Pi powered robots with cameras on them (plus some additional sensors that we may get later).  
-We will work on a making a simple interface to the robots in order to move them and use their sensors, so that they will be used in outreach activities for an educational goal.   
- We will also use this interface inside a bigger system that will let us move our robots from our laptops through a browser page.
