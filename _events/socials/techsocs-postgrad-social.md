Postgrads are such an important part of our society, but we know you're always so busy that it can be difficult to make it to our socials. We don't get to see enough of you!  
  
To fix this, weâ€™re having a social - with drinks on us as usual - where all our postgrads are top of the invite list. We want as many of you to come so that we can meet you, and you can meet each other.  
  
Obviously undergrads are more than welcome, and we encourage you to come along and meet our mighty postgrads. Maybe they'll be able to teach you a thing or two about tech (or drinking).
