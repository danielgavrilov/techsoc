Come join us 1st February for a night of gaming, pizza and socialising revelry! We'll have a PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii all hooked up to large-scale projectors for maximum split-screen glory.  
You'll also find a host of retro PC controllers on hand for some emulated old-school goodness.  
  
Smash Bros, Halo, Mario Kart, Street Fighter, Call of Duty, Bomberman, Wii Sports-- the list goes on!  
  
Pizza, snacks and drinks on the house, of course.   
P.S. Have any extra requests for games? Tell us, and we might just bring it along as well. ;)
