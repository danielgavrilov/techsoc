We are very excited to invite you to the next event on our social calendar, sponsored by Sup, which is featured under 'Best New Apps' on the iOS Appstore!  

If you have an iPhone, please download the app - the link is here https://bnc.lt/KYCg/5b1DTBsGro. Once you have downloaded it, just show us on the day and you will receive a wristband, where drinks will be on Sup!  

Don't worry if you don't have an iPhone, just follow Sup on Instagram/Twitter @supmenow or give them a Like on Facebook!  

A representative from Sup will also be at the event so it will be a great chance to ask any questions about startups or give feedback about the app!  

We will be at Phineas from 7pm to grab some seats and will be playing some drinking games later on in the night, so we hope to see as many of you as possible!
