Happy 10th birthday, TechSoc!  

This October, join us to celebrate 10 years of UCLU TechSoc - everything will be FREE thanks to our amazing sponsors and partners! Food, swag, drinks, the party... There will be special surprises and cool tech too ;)  

We've booked the Front Quad marquee for a fantastic evening. Limited tickets so get yours now!   
(If you are alumni living in London, please get in contact with our committee to get your tickets!)  

For ten years UCLU’s Tech Society has been bridging the gap between students’ ambitions and potential careers; connecting students with industry and to each other through events and initiatives.  

It’s been a platform for the development of technical skills; engaging those new to technology and encouraging those that love it, to provide a community for naturally curious, passionate and creative individuals.  

Come celebrate a special occasion with us, and bring your friends!
