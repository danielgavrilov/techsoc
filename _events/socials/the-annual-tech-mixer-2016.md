It's time for another social, and this time it's going to be bigger and better!   

Following last year's success, UCL's TechSoc, Imperial's DoCSoc, KCL Tech and Goldsmiths' Hacksmiths will be having a mixer on the 15th March.  

We'll be at Kings' Waterfront Bar from 7.30pm and don't forget your student ID's so we can sign you in!   

Look forward to seeing you there!
