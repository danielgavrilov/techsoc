We hope everyone has had a wonderful Christmas break and is now refreshed for term 2!  

This term we’re kicking off the social calendar with a New Year’s social in collaboration with UCL Entrepreneurs. It’ll be at 7.30pm at ULU (The Library) on Saturday the 16th of January, and we hope to see as many of you there as possible.  

As always feel free to bring your friends along, and some drinks will be provided!
