We have time for one final social before the end of term so lets make it a big one!   

Head down to Phineas on Wednesday for a fun filled night with TechSoc, courtesy of the Social Dream Team 2015/16! Join us for the last sports night of the term, where we'll be going to Loop as well!  

As usual, there will be drinks provided and everyone is welcome!  

We will be handing out the awesome TechSoc jumpers, so if you ordered one, make sure you attend so you can collect it.  

Hope to see as many of you there as possible!
