Tickets release on Thursday!  

With the start of the year approaching, we know that going into university can be quite daunting and intimidating. So we decided to start of the year with a fun afternoon picnic with the TechSoc committee members. We like meeting new people, and along with a picnic and fun games at Regents Park, we hope that freshers will have a great start to their year.  

We've also added a slight twist by introducing augmented reality and making use of it to help more in social situations like picnics. So come along for games, free food and friendly faces to mark the start of your amazing experience at university. Since Regent's Park is really big, we'll all be meeting at the Main Quad at 12:35, so be there promptly!
