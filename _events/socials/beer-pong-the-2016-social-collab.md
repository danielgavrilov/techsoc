Join us for our first Social Collab event right back from reading week on Tuesday 15th November!   

Whether you have never played before or consider yourself a seasoned Beer Pong-fessional, come and have a great night with the UCL Entrepreneurs, Business and Tech societies.  

Plenty of drinks (beer and/or cider) for the game provided throughout the night - so all you need is yourself and some competitive spirit!   

See you all there soon!  

Social Collab Team  

At the ULU Gallery, 8 p.m.   
Tables available for beer w/o the pong too.
