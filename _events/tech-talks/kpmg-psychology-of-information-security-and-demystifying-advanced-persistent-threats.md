Hey all, KPMG will be holding 2 tech-talks on the 14th of December!    

Leron Zinatullin will cover the conflicts between the security team and the rest of the business and how to address it by taking a modern, flexible approach that includes the human factor to information security.  

Dimitrios Petropoulos will cover Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)s from an overview, before delving into the attacker's perspective, what makes an APT 'advanced' and finally how the risks APTs pose can be mitigated.  


For more detailed information on the talks, see below.

Psychology of Information Security:  
"Security professionals can often be ignorant of the impact of implementing security policies on end users’ core business activities. End users are, in turn, often unaware of the risk they expose the organisation to by finding workarounds as they believe the organisation values productivity over security. This results in conflict between the security team and the rest of the business, as well as increased risk. We can address this by factoring in an individual’s perspective, knowledge and awareness, and a modern, flexible and adaptable information security approach. Security practices should aim to correct employee's misconceptions by understanding their motivations and working with, not against them – after all, people are a company’s best assets."  


Demystifying Advanced Persistent Threats:  
"The cybersecurity term Advanced Persistent Threat ( ‘APT’) has been widely used as a buzzword for a number of years, and is‘responsible for’ or ‘the means behind’ some of the most notorious cybersecurity breaches. The presentation will attempt to clarify the various meanings of the term, present – from the viewpoint of the attacker- the typical APT lifecycle, discuss the techniques that make an APT ‘advanced’ and lastly offer a glimpse on how APTs can be mitigated from the viewpoint of the defender."
