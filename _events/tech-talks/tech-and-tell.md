We know that technology can be quite intimidating, so we’re running a Tech & Tell event where you get to present projects you’ve worked on and get feedback from people with similar technical minds.   
  
This event is open to everyone, and it's a great way to get started in technology: Whether you’re an expert in a certain technology or you’ve never coded before, it’s definitely a great opportunity to look at how people out there are using at different technologies. We’re also going to have our friends from HackSmiths at Goldsmiths, City Tech from City University of London and other Tech Societies coming over.
