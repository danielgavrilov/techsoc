We're excited to welcome Bryan Dove, Senior Vice President of Engineering at Skyscanner, for our first tech talk of the term!  

Over the last 10+ years, Distributed Systems have become fundamental requirements for anyone building internet scale software. While some problems have been commoditized to be easily accessible (e.g. Spark, Hadoop) to the masses, there are still a number of problems that sound like they should be easy and yet still prove quite difficult at scale. Bryan will share his experiences from building distributed systems at Microsoft, Skype, Amazon, and Skyscanner and the things he's screwed up along the way.  

And as if that wasn't good enough...  
1) Refreshments will be provided.  
2) Skyscanner are recruiting interns and graduates and have recently opened a London office. :)  

See you there!
