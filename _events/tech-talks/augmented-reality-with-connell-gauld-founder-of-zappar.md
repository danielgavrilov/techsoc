Everyone knows what Virtual Reality is, but what about Augmented Reality? (Its lesser-known counterpart that actually involves real life.)  

Augmented Reality is a technology that takes the world around you and adds virtual content on top such that it looks like it's actually there in the real world.  

We've invited Connell Gauld, Founder & Platform Director of Zappar to come and share his experience democratising AR and creating "snackable" Augmented Reality experiences for businesses, brands and publishers from big corps to SMEs.

Zappar is a clever little app that can see and recognise  
images and objects in the world around us.  

With Zappar you can turn almost anything into a TV channel, a video game or even one of those social networking sites. Zappar adds a new visual dimension to the world for you to explore.  

Over the past 4 years we’ve been able to do just that through thousands of experiences and millions of zaps for hundreds of companies across the globe including: Coca-Cola; Hasbro (Transformers); Sony Music (One Direction, Little Mix); Warner Brothers (Scooby-Doo, Batman, Superman); Universal Studios (Minions); PlayStation; Rovio (Angry Birds) Cadbury’s; Asda and Carrefour to name a few.
