UCLU Data Science Society is teaming up with UCLU Tech Society to bring you a hands-on introduction to data science. At this taster session, we will be introducing you to the statistical programming language R, and walking you through a Kaggle challenge.  
  
Take the first step towards understanding machine learning, the fundamental building block in the skill set of a data scientist or data engineer. Get practical experience with R, manipulating data to gain insight from it. Then, learn how to apply predictive models like linear and stepwise regression, regression trees and random forests, as well as how to visualise your models.  
  
After the workshop, we’ll even treat you to some pizza! So if you’ve been waiting for an opportunity to see what data science is about or learn something new, this is your best chance.  
  
PLEASE NOTE:  
The event is free, but you'll need to reserve a place for yourself. Tickets will be released very soon, stay tuned! Also you'll need to bring your own laptop with R and RStudio installed, which you can get from these links:
