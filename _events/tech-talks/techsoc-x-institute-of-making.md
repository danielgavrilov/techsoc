UCLU Technology Society is teaming up with the Institute of Making! Together we’ll be able to collaborate on some amazing stuff, bringing together our tech knowledge with their skills in design and creation, as well as all their awesome equipment and resources.  
  
This event will be the first of many, and will act as an introduction to what they do at the Institute. There will also be some workshops where you can get to stuck into some actual ‘making’. If there’s something you’ve always wanted to make but have never known where to start, come along to learn how the Institute might be able to help you.
