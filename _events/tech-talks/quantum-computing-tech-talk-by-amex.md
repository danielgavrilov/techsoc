Our first tech talk of the year will be about Quantum Computing and it's applications by American Express!   
  
They're bringing members of their engineering team and have kindly sponsored pizza so it'll be a great chance to learn about the technologies they use, chat with the team and see what career opportunities they have on offer whilst munching on some pizza!
