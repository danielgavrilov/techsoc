We're very happy to present the following event, which we have co-organised with the University College London Computer Science Department.  

Presenting a Tech Talk with Mayur Ladwa of Blackrock:  

Historically, a majority of companies have been implementing various data warehouse solutions, possibly with structured data in a star schema environment.   

Given the increasing amount of data and performance benefits of newer technologies, in this talk Mayur will walk through how we at BlackRock use technologies such as Spark and a HDFS compliant file system with columnar storage for a multi-data center architecture that allows employees firm wide to run analytical queries at BlackRock.
