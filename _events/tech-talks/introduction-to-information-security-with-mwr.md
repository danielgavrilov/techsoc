TechSoc is really excited to present our first security themed event, which will be a tech talk with MWR InfoSecurity!  

The talk will be a beginner friendly overview of what information security is - who's involved, what the technology is, and how you can learn more about it. This will include live demos of how to disassemble mobile applications, as well as examples of different attacks in action. There will also be plenty of time to ask questions at the end for anyone who wants to know more.  

We look forwards to seeing you there!  

Monday 7th December, 6.15pm - 8pm in Roberts 103
