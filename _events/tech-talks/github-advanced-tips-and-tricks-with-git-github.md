In this talk, Brent Beer will be speaking about all things Git and GitHub. This lecture will cover some Git tips and tricks to help you get unstuck during your day, make working with a team easier, help you think of ways to write code better, and others. We will also be going into some features of GitHub you may have not known about, such using it for Subversion, closing issues and pull requests from commit messages, how to search better, using Gists for quick files, and more. So, whether you're new to Git or GitHub, wanting to challenge the validity of certain commands (like git bisect), or just looking for some Q&A, please stop by!  

Brent is a software engineer by trade and has been at GitHub for 3 years; first as a trainer and now as a solutions engineer. He is also the author of "Introducing Git", so he literally wrote the book on it. :)
