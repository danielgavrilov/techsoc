We're pleased to announce that our next tech talk will be from Bloomberg!

An email client. An instant messenger. A real-time financial market data viewer and news reader. A portfolio viewer. A note taker, file manager, media viewer, flight planner, restaurant finder..... All built into one secure, mobile application. On 4 different mobile operating systems. Does this sound challenging?

Mark Olleson and Richard Hanes from Bloomberg's Mobile team will discuss how conventional development tools and techniques scale poorly when faced with this challenge, and how Bloomberg tackles the problem.

(If you've applied to Bloomberg or are thinking of doing so, this is also an excellent opportunity to meet people involved in the process and to learn more about the company. :) )
