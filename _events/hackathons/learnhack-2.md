UCL LearnHack is back!  

Have you got ideas that could revolutionise learning? What existing tools would you tweak, re-write, re-build? What  technologies would you like to see more of? What would the perfect learning app look like?  

We're working with the UCL ISD to enable access to technology that matters to you at UCL (e.g. Moodle!) and other cool tech to play with (at the last event, we had BlippAR...) -   
Stay tuned for details!  

Whether you're an art history student, management student, or an CS/EE student person #LearnHack is your chance to make something awesome a reality! #LearnHack is for everyone ...with a valid UCL email address.  

It will be a supportive buzzy place to get inspired, meet amazing people, think big, develop things and learn without boundaries.
