What is Porticode?  
Porticode is a 24-hour tech event run by UCLU Technology Society, where you'll be given all the space, hardware and snacks you'll need to create new and interesting ideas. These kind of events are also known as hackathons, but don't worry! This isn't about hacking into banks or shops, but rather about creating something you think is interesting, life changing, or just plain ridiculous.  

What can you make?   
As long as you can build it with the tech that we have available (as well as any you want to bring), and you can do it in one day, then it's fair game. You can even make it useful for the real world, if you so wish.  

Do I need to be a computer scientist?  
Definitely not! We're specifically catering this event for people who haven't typed a single line of code before. We'll be bringing a selection of gurus and mentors from computer science as well as the tech industry who'll be able to help, as well as running a series of helpful workshops on a variety of topics.  

Our hope is that you'll leave Porticode feeling like you've learned a lot, as well as having a good time.  

What do I get out of it?  
Mainly, you'll have the chance to create something interesting using a bunch of exciting gadgets in a stress-free environment. Unlike events of a similar nature, we're putting a larger emphasis on learning and collaboration, rather than how 'good' the end product is. However, if you're that way inclined, there'll still be a couple of small prizes for the creations that the mentors as well as fellow attendees think are very good.
