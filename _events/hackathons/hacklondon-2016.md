We're ready for another round, and are bringing students and recent graduates interested in technology from all over Europe together once again to learn, build and share at UCLâ€™s campus in the heart of London.  

Join UCLU TechSoc and [KCL Tech](http://kcl.tech) for 24 hours of hacking as we return for the Major League Hacking Spring 2016 season.  

The first batch flew off the shelves, but check out our site for more information and sign up to the newsletter in order to find out when the next batch of tickets will be released! <http://hacklondon.org>
