Hackathons are a great way to meet new people and learn new skills and build a cool project in 24 hours! But if you have never been to a hackathon before, you may feel uneasy or not quite sure where to start.   
  
We'll show you beginner friendly hackathons you can go to, show you examples of previous projects and intro you to some really cool people that attend hackathons so that you can join them!   
  
If you have any questions or anything you want us to cover in advance. Let me know!
