Join us at our inaugural meetup in ISD to talk about the state of University APIs as well as UCL's API and how we can make it better.  
Are you currently working or planning to work on something that uses UCL systems  or UCL data? Come join us and talk about your hopes, experiences, successes, and problems.   

IMPORTANT: this event is held at the ISD office in Euston. The biggest room they have only has capacity for 20 PEOPLE. We will admit the first 20 people that show up at 5pm, so come early if you want a guaranteed spot.  

ISD will be providing refreshments. (Also we heard something about Pizza ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )
