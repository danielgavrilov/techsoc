Join us for our second meetup at the UCL ISD office to talk about developing UCL's API.  

Are you currently working or planning to work on something that uses UCL systems or UCL data? Come join us and talk about your hopes, experiences, successes, and problems.   

IMPORTANT: this event is held at the ISD office in Euston. The biggest room they have only has capacity for 20 PEOPLE. So unfortunately, only the first 20 people that show up will be able to attend.  

We heard something about Pizza again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
