This year we're also organizing a UCL Hub for Google Hash Code!   
  
Google Hash Code is an online programming competition where you attempt to solve real world problems that Google faces.  
  
You can learn more about the competition at https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/overview.html   
  
If you are worried about programming competitions, we still suggest you sign up and have a try! It's a great way to improve your programming skills and there is also a support group for such competitions within UCL.   
  
Be sure to sign up by the 20th February.  
  
Everyone is welcome regardless of their programming skills. People from outside UCL can also attend. We'll provide some bites to keep you going through the competition :)
