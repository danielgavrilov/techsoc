Hey everyone! 

We'll be continuing on with our Android project, now officially named UCLMeets! 

We'll be updating ourselves with progress over reading week and continuing work on the app. 

Shubham will be showing you how to build the front end of the app and will soon provide templates for that. 

We'll be creating the events database in Parse and sorting out user logins.

See you all there!
