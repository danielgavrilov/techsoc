Internship hunting is upon us! We are bringing in a panel of past interns who have worked at different technology companies to share their experience of the application process as well as the company culture.  
  
Whether you're thinking of applying and want some tips or just wondering what it's like to be a technology intern - this is the place to be.   
  
We appreciate the event starts at 7pm, so we'll have plenty of food to keep you going!
