The third edition of our popular beginners’ web-dev series! Following on from our first two sessions, we’ll be learning to use Ruby on Rails in the MVC framework. This session will serve as a thorough introduction to back-end web development.

Missed the last sessions or had to dash early? Catch up with Hugo’s comprehensive tutorials with all materials covered: <http://hugodf.github.io/tutorials/>

Arrive promptly to grab a seat and bring your laptops fully charged, as there are limited sockets.
