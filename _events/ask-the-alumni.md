We have joined forces with the University College London Computer Science Department to organise our first event, Ask the Alumni â€“ a series of talks, panel discussion and Q&A to give current students the chance to hear about our alumni, what they've done since graduating and how their degree has helped them in the tech industry.

All students interested in technology at UCL are warmly invited to join, connect with eachother and network with students over drinks and nibbles afterwards.
