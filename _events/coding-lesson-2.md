The second edition of our popular beginners' web-dev series! Following on from our first session, we'll be creating an AirBnB clone and learning to use jQuery, a Javascript library, to make our pages more interactive and learning how to make our websites responsive and mobile-friendly.

Missed the first session or had to dash early? Catch up with Hugo's comprehensive tutorial, with all the material we covered last week: <http://hugodf.github.io/tutorials/2015/10/10/tutorial.html>

Arrive promptly to grab a seat and bring your laptops fully charged, as there are limited sockets.
