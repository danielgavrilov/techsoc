CS50 Week is back this year with a brand new track! Each week will be exploring different topics in computer science and each session will be independent to each other! We will be covering skills such as widely used programming concepts and making your own website! :) You don't need to worry about missing a week and falling behind anymore. This week we will be looking at algorithms in programming! Come along to learn more about the fundamentals of algorithms in programming and how they are used and analysed :)
