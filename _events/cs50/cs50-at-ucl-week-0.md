This is CS50 at UCL and we will be starting the course with Week 0 on the 13th of October! NO programming experience is required, if you want to learn programming (specifically, programming in C) from the best introductory Computer Science course, join us for the first week!   
Things to bring: Your laptop and an interest to learn :)
