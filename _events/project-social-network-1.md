We are starting a new web development project where we will be building a social network!

This is a beginner level project that will involve creating a backend service using Python as well as a chance for people to use their HTML/CSS skills for a good cause!

The idea is to create a platform that allow universities like us to outreach to high school/sixth form students and provide opportunities , resources and advice to help promote computer science learning.

As with any project, we will discuss and take in all your thoughts to come up with a final deliverable and walk you through the Django framework (which is used to build Instagram and Pinterest).

If you have any questions, let us know!
