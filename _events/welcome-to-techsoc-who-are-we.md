What is TechSoc? What do we do? What events are we running this year? These questions and more will be answered during this talk!  
  
As well as telling you about the many tech talks, workshops, projects and hackathons that are coming up, we'll also introduce you to the bustling and friendly tech and hacking communities around London, who hold meetups pretty much weekly.  
  
Finally, members of the TechSoc committee will be present so that you can ask us anything about TechSoc, the tech community, or just living in London! Our membership fees have been scrapped for this year, so feel free to join us!
