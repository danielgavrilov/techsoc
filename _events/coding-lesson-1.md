Totally new to tech but keen to get started? Join us for the first session of "Coding & Cookies", our weekly web development classes especially for beginners.

In this session, we will be building an online CV so that you can showcase your skills! This will get you started with HTML and CSS, the first ports of call for any aspiring web developer. If time provides, we'll also be moving on to looking Git, a version control system which is used for collaborating on code and backing it up, as well as Github Pages, one of the easiest channels to use to get your website up on the web.

Before the session, please install Sublime Text and Sourcetree, and create an account on Github:
Sublime Text - <http://www.sublimetext.com/2>
Sourcetree (Git client) - <https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/>
Github - <https://github.com/>

Bring yourselves, your laptops and a desire for learning and be prepared to munch on free cookies.
