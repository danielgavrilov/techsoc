We are very excited to invite all of you to an event organised by the Computer Science department, an insight to a career in the gaming industry with a UCL CS alumni, Sadia Rahman (Senior Software Engineer (Gameplay & AI) at Ubisoft).  
  
Sadia graduated with a degree in MEng Computer Science in 2007, worked in Electronic Arts, Supermassive Games in Guildford, and moved to Ubisoft in Singapore to work on the Assassin's Creed games.   
  
She will be speaking about the different disciplines of software engineers in video games, and briefly going over the development process and what it's like.   
  
In her words, "It's more of an opportunity for students to ask questions cause I know I wish I had that when I was a student!"
