Tech Talk:
In the age of ubiquitous mobile devices with increasing computation power and sensing capabilities, location-based apps and services are still facing many hurdles to accurately and truthfully understand where the user is. Solving this problem requires a multidimensional approach that spans the entire technological stack, from mobile sensors and hardware enhancements to large-scale data processing and machine intelligence.

Salvatore Scellato, Software Engineer at Google, will cover the technological challenges characterising the process of precisely locating a device, understanding the semantics associated with a location, and gaining insights about how users move around and experience the world.

Alum Insight:
You'll also hear from Tina Fallahi, a UCL alum who recently started working at Google full-time.

Opportunities at Google:
We'll finish up by highlighting internship and full-time opportunities at Google.
