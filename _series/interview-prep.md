Coding interview preparation group is an informal get-together of members who are preparing/doing coding interviews.

For a question, we normally break into pairs where one person will be the interviewer and the other the interviewee, we allocate approximately 20 minutes to a question. Afterwards we encourage members to share solutions and other members to ask questions/ suggest improvements to the proposed solution. Once we think we have achieved the best time and space complexity (or we've run out of time), we move onto the next question.

Bring questions, pen, paper and a smile!
