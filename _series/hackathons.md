We love hackathons here at TechSoc! Whether we’re running our own or venturing across the UK and beyond, you’re bound to find us working on a cool new project.

A hackathon is a 12&ndash;36 hour invention marathon where programmers, designers, builders and more come together to learn, build, and share. In the past, we’ve hosted a seriously successful Local Hack Day with our local community and we’ll be hosting [HackLondon](http://hacklondon.org) with [KCL Tech](http://kcl.tech) in February 2016. Until then, join us as we hit up hackathons in London and around the UK.
