		Getting into technology can be difficult: you don't know where to look or what to look at, so we thought we'd put together a collection of our favourite resources that we, as members of UCLU TechSoc, have used to learn in the past!
		</p>

		<p>
		If you know a really good learning resource, feel free to let us know about it!
		</p>

		<p>
		We've colour coded the resources depending on the audience:

		<img class="resource-level level-beginner level-key"> Beginner <tb>
		<img class="resource-level level-medium level-key"> Medium
		<img class="resource-level level-pro level-key"> Advanced

	<div class="responsive-boxes">
	{% for category in categories %}
