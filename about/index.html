      <p>We are one of the largest student-run societies, and the only all-encompassing technology society at University College London. Our membership is open to anyone and everyone in the UCL and IoE community.</p>
      <p>We aim to make technology accessible, engaging and fun for our members, whilst encouraging a viral growth of interest in technology in the wider UCL community.</p>
      <p>TechSoc creates a network that bridges the gap between studentsâ€™ ambitions and potential careers; connecting them to those in the industry and to each other.</p>
      <p>Our society is also a platform for the development of technical skills; engaging those new to technology and encouraging those that love it.</p>
