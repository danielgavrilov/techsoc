      <p>
        We are the only all-encompassing technology society at University College London. Our membership is open to anyone and everyone in the UCL and IoE community.
      </p>
      <p>
        We help bridge the gap between studentsâ€™ ambitions and potential careers; connecting them to those in the industry and to each other, with talks from across a range of industries, alongside career and alumni events. </p>
      <p>
        Our society is also a platform for the development of technical skills; engaging those new to technology and encouraging those that love it, from the project groups to tutorials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately we aim to provide a community for naturally curious, passionate and creative individuals who are willing to make a positive impact to connect with each other.
